      "Ingredients needed (with substitutions) Olive oil – You can sauté the vegetables with water or vegetable stock to make it oil free if needed. Onion, garlic, and ginger – You can make this recipe even easier by using pre-minced garlic and grated ginger in a tube. If you don’t have fresh ginger, replace it with 1 teaspoon of powdered ginger. Curry powder – Use a brand you like, mild or spicy. Sweet potato – Or use white, yellow, or red potatoes instead. Cauliflower, broccoli, carrots, and red bell peppers – Curry is a great clean-out-your-fridge meal, which means you can use the vegetables listed in the recipe card or whatever is available in your fridge. Both fresh and frozen vegetables work well. Canned lentils – This is the main protein in the curry. Feel free to use chickpeas or another vegan protein, like diced seitan chicken, soy curls, or fried tofu. Coconut milk – Use light coconut milk to make it lighter or coconut cream for a richer sauce. Cashew cream will work as an easy alternative (all you need is cashews, water, and a blender). Or vegan unsweetened yogurt. Thai red curry paste – This is the one I use. Red curry paste is the spiciest of the three kinds of curry paste (red, green, and yellow) but most of the spice is hidden behind the coconut milk and aromatics, leaving you with a mild to medium spiced curry. Salt Cornstarch – To help thicken the sauce. Sugar – The sweetness is important for balance, so try not to skip the tiny bit of sugar. Feel free to use maple syrup instead. Lime juice Baby spinach – Fresh preferably. Or use kale. Cilantro – For garnish! You can leave it out if you don’t like cilantro. ",
